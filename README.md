# hi there ðŸ‘‹

i'm mainly full-stack and web3 dev. for web or mobile apps, i like to use flutter or astro. otherwise, i do the rest of my projects in go. you'll see some python code in my repos but it's mainly for prototyping, and they are often rewritten in go afterwards ðŸ˜¬.

i also like to tinker with a lot of things, especially when it comes to music or
design ðŸŽ¹.

most of my repos are private, but feel free to have a look at my public repositories,
there might be something you like ðŸ‘€.
