# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm mainly full-stack and web3 dev. For web or mobile apps, I like to use Flutter or Astro. Otherwise, I do the rest of my projects in Go. You'll see some Python code in my repos but it's mainly for prototyping, and they are often rewritten in Go afterwards ðŸ˜¬.

I also like to tinker with a lot of things, especially when it comes to music or
design ðŸŽ¹.

Most of my repos are private, but feel free to have a look at my public repositories,
there might be something you like ðŸ‘€.
