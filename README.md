# Hi there 👋

I'm mainly a web3 and full-stack dev but also pentester in my spare time 🕵️.

I like to tinker with a lot of things, especially when it comes to music or
design 🎛️.

Most of my repos are private, but feel free to have a look at my public repositories,
there might be something you like 🤷.

## Some cool stuff I've worked on 🚀

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/tun43p/dotfiles) - _My dotfiles for macOS_
- [koala](https://github.com/tun43p/koala) - _Cool toolkit for my pentesting needs
  with Docker_
- [scranr](https://github.com/tun43p/scranr) - _A simple script to show which ports
  are open written in Python_
- [tun43p](https://github.com/tun43p/tun43p) - _A monorepo with all my personal stuff_
- [url-shortener](https://github.com/tun43p/url-shortener/tree/main) - _A simple
  URL shortener written in Go_
